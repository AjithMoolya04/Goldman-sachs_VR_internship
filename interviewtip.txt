“Why are you interested in this role?”

I recently participated in Goldman Sachs’ job simulation on Forage and it was
incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to work as a governance
analyst there. This simulation enabled me to build my experience cracking
passwords using a range of tools including Hashcat.
Once I had cracked passwords I was able to come up with a range of uplifts to
suggest that would increase the overall level of password protection across the
organization.
Through this experience, I’ve validated that I really enjoy working on highly
impactful technical projects in great detail. I can see just how this project
would have a significant impact on Goldman Sachs as a company and on its
customers by increasing the level of security to reduce the risk of a successful
hack.
In future, I would love to apply what I’ve learned during this job simulation in
a governance team at Goldman Sachs.
